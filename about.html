        I learned to code during my second semester at university. Our class was focused on
        introducing the fundamentals of scientific computing and for this purpose
        we were taught mainly in FORTRAN. The second mandatory programming course
        on the fourth semester was
        even more focused on scientific computing, but it was largely outdated.

        We would build programs to calculate and generate some
        big tables with the approximation and predicted errors. If this doesn't sound fun, it's because it isn't.

        I shifted my learning approach after learning more about GUI development through a book that was
        given to me by a friend. I was fascinated with the idea of building interfaces. Rather than running
        everything on the same old boring terminal screen, I could give programs
        a bit of personality and make them responsive to commands and user inputs.
         The book also contained a lot of examples, which
        was very helpful and fun to play with. Since then, my approach to programming has been mainly
         to learn by building it.
        This means that my knowledge of theoretical computer science and even
        classical algorithm stuff is rather limited, my experinece being confined
        to solving a couple of leetcode problems here and there. This is something
        that I intend to remedy this one day.
         My main interests at the time however
        remain GUI and web development, as well as scientific computing. Throughout the years I gathered
         some experience as a Full Stack developer and am on the process of finish building some
          applications using React,
          Node, Vanilla, Django, MySQL, Docker, Ruby on Rails,   Vue, among other tools.
             You can check some of my finished projects on this website.
