        This was my capstone project for the Google data analytics course. I analyzed data available 
        online about the funds destined to combat and prevent CoV-19 spread in Brasilia. My main objective 
        has been basically to identify some of the major creditors and their related areas of actuation.
        <br>
        <br>
        Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the  government of Brasilia 
        has destinated over 1.7 bi reais (300 mi usd) together with 800 mi reais (140 mi usd) received from the central government
        to combat the spread of the virus in the capital.
         The <a href="http://www.transparencia.df.gov.br/#/">transparency portal</a> on the government's website already provides a number of details on how 
         major funds are being 
         allocated with useful graph visualizations, but for the costs related to COVID this is somewhat still
          lacking. The thing
          I was 
         mainly interested in was knowing who the biggest creditors were and possibly nailing down their
          related areas of actuation.
        <br>
        <br>

        I started by exporting the data available on the website and to generate the list of biggest creditors, I
        ran the command with pandas on a jupyter notebook:
        <br>
        <br>
        <i>
        total_pay = df.groupby(by='Credor').agg(
        <br>
            lambda x: x.astype(float).sum()
        <br>
        )
        <br>
        total_pay
        <br>

        realpay = total_pay.sort_values(by=['Total Pago'], ascending=False)
        <br>
        realpay
        <br>
        <br>
        </i>


        
        This wasn't so easy to figure it out and the correct syntax was only realized after digging out a
        little. The main challenge was discovering a way to sum all repeated values in the dataframe and
        afterwards group all of them in descending order.
        An alternative considered was the following piece of code in R which achieves the same thing:
        <br>
        <br>
        <i>
            df <- data.table(df)
            <br>
            df[ , .(val= sum(val)), by = "Credor" ]
        </i>
        <br>
        <br>
        Next I selected the first 10 biggest creditors in order to break down their areas of actuation.
        The pie chart in the picture below shows that no major amount of funds is being destined to a sole
        creditor, with the biggest share pertaining to a sector of the government (1). The other creditors
        are shown in this <a href="media/data-table1.png">table.</a>
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="media/data-graph1.png" width="600" height="290" style="border: 2px solid #555; border-radius: 5%;">
        <br>
        <br>
        One thing worth pointing out is that although marketing(6) only constitutes a small fraction
         of the pie chart, the costs related to it surpass for instance those spent with 
         social pension(8) as can be noted in the bar graph above. Although marketing is certainly a 
         worthwhile investment, since people need to be kept up to date with the latest news and 
         governments endeavours during the pandemic, one might wonder if the cost isn't a little 
         too saturated. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The same analysis can be carried out for the resources that were allocated with the money
        received from the central government. The table of creditors can be found <a href="data-table2.png">here</a>
        and the results are expressed in the graphs below.
        

        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="media/data-graph2.png" width="600" height="290" style="border: 2px solid #555; border-radius: 5%;">
        <br>
        <br>
        As expected, the biggest creditors are the same as the ones before, but this time BINDER F.C
        is not present in the top ten. This might indicate that no money from the central govt. was used for
         marketing. Confirmation of this might be found in the list 
         of <a href="http://www.coronavirus.df.gov.br/index.php/contratacoes/">emergency contracts</a>
          that were closed during the pandemic 
         and already provides a big list of creditors.
         <br>
         <br>
        As a final analysis, I took the data that was allocated for specific purposes and generated the graphs
        below. We note that most of the resources were allocated to services related to food (87.7%)
        with the rest being destined to mobility (7.4%), emergency aid (3.7%) and cultural and artistic related costs
        (1.2%).
