        My blog on German etymology. I write short posts about the origins of words and sayings. The site itself was built with Django with the goal of being as minimalistic as possible. Challenges included were pagination, a commentary system and a way to render images into posts.
        <br>
        <br>
        I've been interested in etymology ever since I was a kid. One of my earliest memories is reading a weekly column on the local newspaper, which would tell of the origins of words and popular expressions in Portuguese. My
        mother is also a Language major, so the topic has always been a source of much amusement at the house.
        <br>
        <br>
        When I started learning German I had a goal of writing a text each day, a journey that has been documented <a href="https://langcorrect.com/account/user/alisson/journals/">here.</a>
        Since this approach was so effective, I didn't want to stop even after completing 365 days of continuously
        writing at Langcorrect. I started learning a bit of Django each day with the sole goal of building the blog. Luckily
        a lot of tutorials are available online and so most of my headaches were with particular stuff I wanted
        to implement.
        <br>
        <br>
        One problem in the beginning was rendering images. Although it is possible to have images directly on the static files
        folder, this is certainly not ideal if you want more control on where to place each image etc. I was certain there had
        to be a way around this and searching online eventually led me to <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/django-inline-media/">django-inline-media.</a> This is a really nice project by Daniela Rus which
        gives the user a lot more control when handling images and static files. But here's the catch, there's a much
        easier way to do this. If one chooses to host images somewhere else and simply use the common html tag 
        for images within the post, the command won't render it initially
        but it does after including the <i>safe</i> filter, as in <i>{ txt | safe}</i>. This truly baffled me, curiously enough it seems like no one talks
        about this functionality for placing images on posts.
        <br>
        <br>
        Responsive design was also a major headache. Even now I feel like the site is not perfectly well built
        in the mobile version. At least it's functional and readable, so that's gotta be a plus. You can compare
        the layouts for yourself:
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="media/wort1.gif" width="385" height="400" style="border: 2px solid #555; border-radius: 5%;">
        <img src="media/wort2.gif" width="195" height="400" style="border: 2px solid #555; border-radius: 5%;">
        <br>
        <br>

        When everything was ready, I deployed it with Heroku and enabled the simplest Dyno in order to ensure SSL certification
        was in place. There was then some consideration about moving the database to AWS, but I found it worked fine with PostGre
        provided by Heroku, and so with all migrations in place the site was lauched on Sept. 1st of 2021. You
        can read all the posts <a href="https://wortweise.herokuapp.com">here.</a>
